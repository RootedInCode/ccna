# 🔌 Day 01 – Switches & Routers (Network Basics)

## 🧠 Topics Covered:
- **Switches**: 
  - Operate at Layer 2 (Data Link)
  - Maintains a CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table [Vlan , Source MAC Address , Type(Static / Dynamic) , Port(eg. Fa0/1)] to forward frames using MAC addresses
  - Each port is a collision domain

- **Routers**:
  - Operate at Layer 3 (Network)
  - Route packets using IP addresses
  - Each interface is a broadcast domain

-**ARP*:
  - ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) is used to discover MAC address of dest. via broadcast.
  - **Command used** - enable 
                     - # show mac-address-table

## 🛠️ Tools/Visuals:
- Watched: NetworkChuck – Switches vs Routers
- Notes taken on how data flows through networks
- Understood segmentation of networks and their role in security
- Packet tracer

## 🔁 Lab:
- Practice building a LAN with switches, routers, DNS, access points on Packet Tracer
- Default gateways and subnetting
